    Welcome to our exquisite villa perched above the Cez river on the outskirts of Sainte Ambroix in the Gard. Just minutes from the extensive amenities of the town and within easy distance of three world heritage sites and other historic attractions, this luxurious retreat offers uninterrupted views across the valley. With its timeless blend of elegance and modern comfort, it promises an unforgettable holiday for families, friends or couples seeking a secluded romantic getaway.

    As you arrive at the villa, you'll be captivated by the stunning stone facade adorned with blooming bougainvillea, exuding rustic romance. Surrounded by lush gardens, fragrant lavender fields, and ancient olive groves, the property offers a serene ambiance and breathtaking views of the Provençal countryside.

    Step inside the villa to find a seamless blend of traditional French architecture and contemporary design. Elegant furnishings, white, high-beamed ceilings and stone floors create a calm and relaxing atmosphere. The spacious main living room has windows on two sides that bathe the space in natural light and showcase spectacular views, whilst electric shutters shut out the heat of the day. A stylish kitchen is equipped with everything needed to prepare delicious meals from local ingredients and leads through to a second tranquil living room with a log burner for cooler autumn evenings.

{% block acc_sl3_des %}
    Comfortably accommodating eight guests in three doubles and one twin room, each bedroom is elegantly and individually styled to suit the age of the property, with cool cotton bed linen and towels adding further touches of luxury. Thought has been given to keeping youngsters safe and amused in the early mornings, with the large first floor landing equipped with TV, Xbox, DVDs and games. There is a family bathroom with shower and a separate toilet on the first floor, and a ground floor shower room with toilet that is easily accessible from the pool area.

    The large pool area surrounded by olive trees is perfectly designed and equipped for fun, relaxing and eating outside. After barbequing by the pool you and your guests can eat comfortably together under the wisteria edged canopy, before sunbathing or relaxing in the shaded poolside lounge area. A second, but connected, covered terrace offers space for table tennis and board games whilst protected from the sun. Bounded by a disused railway line and wooded hillside to the rear, the villa, pool and garden cannot be overlooked.

    <br>
    Stone Mas, stunning view in an elevated position at the very edge of the town, the house and grounds are not overlooked and have unbroken views along the river Ceze and across a wooded valley to the hills beyond, yet the property is only minutes from supermarkets and the full facilities of Sainte Ambroix - an historic, thriving medieval market town with many cafés and restaurants.<br>
    <br>
    Outside areas offer a variety of both sunny and shaded spaces to eat, relax or play: two large covered patios with dining tables, outdoor cooking area, 40m2 pool and additional poolside shaded seating area.<br>
    <br>
    The main living room and the open-plan, well equipped kitchen are bright and modern with full glass walls on two sides and electric shutters to keep them cool. A second cosy sitting room with feature fireplace and wood burner leads on to an office equipped with printer and monitor should you need to work during your stay.<br>
    <br>
    Four bedooms (three double one twin) are individually styled, with the two main rooms offering fantastic views over the valley. There is a family shower room with toilet and a second toilet on the first floor, as well as a shower room with toilet on the ground floor.<br>
    <br>
    Saint Ambroix is in the upper valley of the Cèze; located at the eastern edge of the Cevennes only 30 minutes southwest of the Ardèche Gorges and the unmissable Vallon Pont d’Arc. Ideally located for exploring the “villages de caractère” such as Lussan and its potteries, antiques market in Barjac or the historic market town of Uzès, the property is also around an hour and a quarter drive from three world heritage sites; Pont du Gard, the amphitheatre at Orange, the Palais de Pape at Avignon.<br>
